Includes two now playing variants, two agenda variants, one picture gallery and an icon sized weather widget, each with loads of customisation options - check the settings panel to make sure you get it just right. And a special OCD wallpaper to help you line them up with your icon layout.\r\n\r\nThe main music widget now defaults to showing a gallery from Unsplash. You can still set it to be blank in the options or set your own image, by adding your own file \"Artwork.jpg\" to the widget folder\r\n\r\nIn the mini music widget, the displayed icon now matches your choice of linked music app (requests welcome!)"
